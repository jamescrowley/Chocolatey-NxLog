    <description>nxlog is a modular, multi-threaded, high-performance log management solution with multi-platform support. In concept it is similar to syslog-ng or rsyslog but is not limited to unix/syslog only. It can collect logs from files in various formats, receive logs from the network remotely over UDP, TCP or TLS/SSL . It supports platform specific sources such as the Windows Eventlog, Linux kernel logs, Android logs, local syslog etc. Writing and reading logs to/from databases is also supported. </description>

    <releaseNotes>### 2015-12-08 2.9.1504

* Added a workaround for an APR bug where the memory pool allocated by the APR pollset could grow too large under heavy load under linux/epoll.
* om_http will now attempt to reconnect on all errors.
* Add locking to the dbi modules as a workaround for the mysql_init race condition issue.
* The dbi modules can now use the new reeantrant API if libdbi provides it.
* Fixed a memory leak caused by convert_fields("AUTO").
* The JSON parser can automatically detect datetime values - no need to call parsedate().
* Field limit in CSV parser was raised to 200.
* xm_gelf handles ShortMessage as is without doing any truncation if it exists.
* Fixed a leak in xm_fileop's file_remove() and another in the regexp replacement operator when using /g.
* parsedate() can now also handle integer timestamps with an optional fractional part.
* Enhanced the replace() function to handle undefined values better.
* Add locking to the dbi modules as a workaround for the mysql_init race condition issue.
* The dbi modules can now use the new reeantrant API if libdbi provides it.
* Fixed a memory leak caused by convert_fields("AUTO").
* There was a memory leak in xm_kvp module's to_kvp().
* The linebased reader did not trim trailing CR when CRLF was on the buffer boundary.
* The to_syslog_snare() formatter creates the date string with double digits instead of padding with space.
* Flow-control is explicitly disabled with reroute() and add_to_route().
* Fixed an issue in im_file getting into a loop with CloseWhenIdle enabled.
* IETF Syslog parser properly skips UTF BOM header.
* The set_request_path() procedure in om_http was leaking memory.
* Deleted files could cause an excessive logging of "input file was deleted" in im_file.
* A &lt;QueryXML&gt; block has been added to im_msvistalog that can be used to specify the XML query without using '\' to join multiple lines.
* &lt;Exec&gt; can be used as a block to avoid line continuation breaks '\'.
* The IN operator has been implemented.
* Fixed an issue related to the csv parser creating undefined values that could lead to a crash in some cases.
* The string() function was leaking memory.
* Some large eventlog entries caused a crash or hang with im_msvistalog.
* Updated openssl libraries on windows to 1.0.2a to support TLSv1.2.
* The om_tcp and om_ssl modules now provide a reconnect() procedure.</releaseNotes>
